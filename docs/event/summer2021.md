# Summer 2021

`Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan` (hereinafter referred to as `summer 2021`) is a summer program for college students jointly organized by `Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences` and `openEuler community`. It aims to encourage college students to actively participate in the development and maintenance of open source software and promote the vigorous development of excellent open source software community. We will cooperate with major open source communities to provide projects for the development and maintenance of important open source software, and will open enrollment to college students around the world.

Students can choose the projects they are interested in to apply, and obtain the opportunity of the senior maintainer (community mentor) to guide them. According to the difficulty and completion of the project, participants will also receive the bonus of `Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan` .

Hypertrons community also join the Summer 2021 and provides several ideas for students to choose. We hope students can build the community together.

## Ideas

### 1. Customized React chart library

- Description

As an extension and important part of the function of `hypertrons`, `hypertrons-crx` can insert dashboards into specific `GitHub` pages to help users gain the insight into developers and projects. The project currently uses `Echarts` and `Antv` as visualization tools. In order to provide a good interactive experience and simplify the configuration process, it is necessary to encapsulate and customize the charts used in the project (e.g. graph, radar and table). We can implement the `React` component based on Echarts, Antv or other visualization engines.
